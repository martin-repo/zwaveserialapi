# Z-Wave Serial API

This API is for developers who want to create their own home automation tool. If you're looking for a fully featured solution you may want to use [Home Assistant](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/), and connect to it via REST API and/or WebSocket API.

Since this API doesn't support Z-Wave protocol security it should not be used for home security, door locks, etc.
